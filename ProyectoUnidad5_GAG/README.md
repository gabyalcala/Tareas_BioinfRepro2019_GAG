This directory contains data and scripts generated from the study entitled [Genome‐wide genotyping of a novel Mexican Chile Pepper collection illuminates the history of landrace differentiation after Capsicum annuum L. domestication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12651) and is divided into the following subdirectories:

* **data**

It contains data in file in variant call format (vcf) from the study made by Taitano N, Bernau V, Jardón-Barbolla L, Leckie B, Mazourek M, Mercer K, McHale L, Michel A, Baumler D, Kantar M, van der Knapp E (2018) Data from: Genomewide genotyping of a novel Mexican Chile Pepper collection illuminates the history of landrace differentiation after Capsicum annuum L. domestication.

* **bin**

It has the scripts that were used for analyzing the data. 
   **samples** 
  1.- Extract the names of each sample [./samples/1samples_name.sh](./samples/1samples_name.sh)
   **diversity** contains the scripts to calculate nucleotide diversity, F<sub>ST</sub>, expected (H<sub>exp</sub>)and observed (H<sub>obs</sub>) heterozygosities.
   **popultaion_structure** contains the scripts to ADMIXTURE and  discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC).


* **figures**

It has the scripts used to produce the figures obtained from the current project.
